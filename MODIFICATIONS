Modifications in improvements branch:
* More leverage of (static) type-safety.
* More specific exception catching. This might result in more Runtime Exceptions "leaking" through (intentionally).
* Extend size of MPI arrays to maximum Java supported capacity (OTR supports 32 bits lengths, otr4j currently supports up to Integer.MAX_VALUE-8 items.)
* Safely calling listeners such that faulty listener implementations do not interrupt protocol/message processing.
* Fixed potential exceptions due to negative array sizes caused by interpretation of ints as signed in unserialization.
* Fixed issue with SM exponent and group element verification.
* Reduce unnecessary use of null.
* General simplification of code by removing redundant constructions.
* Updated obsolete collections.
* Better synchronization of containers in multi-threaded situations.
* Use of thread-unsafe classes in local context.
* Correct inconsistencies in javadoc/variable naming.
* Better/correct closing of stream resources.
* Smart use of try-finally to ensure correct closing.
